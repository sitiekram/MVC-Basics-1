<p>Here are some of my projects that I have made after starting the course.</p>
<h3>Hangman Game</h3>
<p>
    This is a famous game in which you guess the unknown word.You can guess for the specific letter at a time or can guess the whole word.
    <br>You have 10 guesses to find the word unless you will lose the game.It is very good instrument for developing vocabulary skill.<br>
